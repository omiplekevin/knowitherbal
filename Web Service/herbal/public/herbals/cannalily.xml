		<properties>Canna lily is a perennial succulent herb with unbranched stem. Leaves are oblong, acute or acuminate, bright green or tinged with maroon or red, with entire margins. Inflorescence is terminal. Flowers are irregular, showy, red, yellow, or pink, plain or with tiny blotches on petals. Fruit is a 3-valved capsule. Most Cannas cultivated in Philippine gardens are the results of hybridization between species, notably C. indica, C. flaccida, C. glauca and C. coccinea. Hybridization has led to the use of names like Canna x indica, Canna x glauca, etc. For simplicity, some prefer to call all ornamental hybrids as Canna x generalis.</properties>
